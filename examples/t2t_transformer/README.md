The distributed T2T Transformer training application that had been used as a test
application and requirement provider towards TensorHive is now in a
[separate repository](https://github.com/roscisz/dnn_training_benchmarks/tree/master/TensorFlowV1_T2T-Transformer_English-German).

See the [TensorHive examples directory](https://github.com/roscisz/TensorHive/tree/master/examples) for

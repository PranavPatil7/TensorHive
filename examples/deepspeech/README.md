# DeepSpeech test application

The distributed DeepSpeech training application that had been used as a test
application and requirement provider towards TensorHive is now in a
[separate repository](https://github.com/roscisz/dnn_training_benchmarks/tree/master/TensorFlowV1_DeepSpeech_ldc93s1).

The application has been also used in the TensorHive task execution
module example for the [TensorFlow ClusterSpec](https://github.com/roscisz/TensorHive/tree/master/examples/TensorFlow_ClusterSpec)
scenario. See also the [TensorHive examples directory](https://github.com/roscisz/TensorHive/tree/master/examples) for other
examples how TensorHive task execution module can be used for various training scenarios.
